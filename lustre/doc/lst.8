.SH NAME
lst \- Start the Lustre LNET Self-test
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "lst"
.SH DESCRIPTION
LNET self-test helps site administrators confirm that Lustre
Networking (LNET) has been properly installed and configured.
The self-test also confirms that LNET and the network software
and hardware underlying it are performing according to expectations.
.LP
Every LNET self-test runs in the context of a session.  A node can be
associated with only one session at a time to ensure the session has
exclusive use of the nodes on which it is running. A session is created,
controlled and monitored from a single node; this is referred to as the
self-test console.
.LP
Any node may act as the self-test console.  Nodes are named and allocated
to a self-test session in groups.  This allows all nodes in a group to
be referenced by a single name.
.LP
Test configurations are built by describing and running test batches.
A test batch is simply a named collection of tests, with each test
composed of a number of individual point-to-point tests running in parallel.
These individual point-to-point tests are instantiated according to the
test type, source group, target group and distribution specified when the
test is added to the test batch.
.LP
.SH MODULES
To run LNET self-test, load these modules: libcfs, lnet, lnet_selftest
and any one of the klnds (i.e, ksocklnd, ko2iblnd...).
To load all necessary modules, run modprobe lnet_selftest, which
recursively loads the modules that lnet_selftest depends on.
.LP
There are two types of nodes for LNET self-test: the console node and
test nodes. Both node types require all previously-specified modules
to be loaded. (The userspace test node does not require these modules.)
.LP
Test nodes can be in either kernel or userspace.  A console user can
invite a kernel test node to join the test session by running
.I "lst add_group NID",
but the user cannot actively add a userspace test node to the
test-session.  However, the console user can passively accept a test
node to the test session while the test node runs lstclient to connect
to the console.
.SH UTILITIES
LNET self-test has two user utilities, lst and lstclient.
.LP
.B lst
is the user interface for the self-test console (run on console node).
It provides a list of commands to control the entire test system,
such as create session, create test groups, etc.
.LP
.B lstclient
is the userspace self-test program, which is linked with userspace
LNDs and LNET. A user can use lstclient to join a self-test session:
.nf
lstclient -sesid CONSOLE_NID group NAME
.fi
.SH EXAMPLE SCRIPT
Below is a sample LNET self-test script which simulates the traffic
pattern of a set of Lustre servers on a TCP network, accessed by Lustre
clients on an IB network (connected via LNET routers), with half the
clients reading and half the clients writing.
.LP
.nf
#!/bin/bash
export LST_SESSION=$$
lst new_session read/write
lst add_group servers 192.168.10.[8,10,12-16]@tcp
lst add_group readers 192.168.1.[1-253/2]@o2ib
lst add_group writers 192.168.1.[2-254/2]@o2ib
lst add_batch bulk_rw
lst add_test --batch bulk_rw --from readers --to servers \
    brw read check=simple size=1M
lst add_test --batch bulk_rw --from writers --to servers \
    brw write check=full size=4K
# start running
lst run bulk_rw
# display server stats for 30 seconds
lst stat servers & sleep 30; kill $!
# tear down
lst end_session

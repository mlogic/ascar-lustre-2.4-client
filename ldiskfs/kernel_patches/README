This directory contains the patches needed to convert ext4 into ldiskfs.

We need to be able to create a version of ldiskfs from the ext4 source
code found in multiple versions of the kernel.  That ext4 source code can
vary quite a bit between different versions of the kernel, which means
that it is impossible to maintain one set of patches that will cleanly
apply to all versions of ext4.

Where to put a new patch
------------------------

Therefore, we split the patches into multiple subdirectories in the
"patches" directory.  These subdirecotories are named after the
version of the Linux distribution against which they were developed.
For instance, "patches/rhel6.3" and "patches/sles11sp1".

When creating a new patch, put it in the subdirectory for the
distribution for which it was first created.

Sharing patches
---------------

Often a patch will apply cleanly to multiple kernel's ext4 code.

If a patch from a different distribution's subdirectory applies cleanly,
it should be included directly in that distribution's series file rather
than making a copy of the patch.  As an example, lets consider two
distribution directories:

  patches/rhel6.3
  patches/sles11sp1

If a patch named "patches/rhel6.3/foo.patch" applies cleanly and is
needed by the sles11sp1 ext4 code, the sles11sp1 series file should
directly list "patches/rhel6.3/foo.patch".  A copy of the same patch
should only be made when the patch will not apply without changes.

Refreshing patches for a new kernel/distribution
------------------------------------------------

When adding support for a new OS distribution release and its new
version of the kernel, it is common to begin by copying the patch
series file from a similar OS release.  For instance, when beginning
to add support for the RHEL 6.4 kernel, one might copy the
series/ldiskfs-2.6-rhel6.3.series file to the new name
series/ldiskfs-2.6-rhel6.4.series.

When applying that series, some patches are likely to succeed and others
to fail to apply.  When a patch fails to apply, a copy of it should be
made into a new distribution subdirectory before refreshing that patch.
In this way, support for the new kernel may be added without breaking
support for the previous kernel.  As an example, if the patch:

  patches/rhel6.3/foo.patch

fails to apply as part of series/ldiskfs-2.6-rhel6.4.series, the developer
would copy the patch to:

  patches/rhel6.4/foo.patch

The next step would be to edit series/ldiskfs-2.6-rhel6.4.series to point
to the new patch.  Finally, the developer may edit files and "quilt refresh"
the new patch.

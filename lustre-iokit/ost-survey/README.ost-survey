ost-survey (OST performance survey)
===================================
	This script is designed to test the client-to-disk performance 
of the individual OSTs in a Lustre filesystem.  The network transfer 
time from the client is included; to get a better idea of the isolated
disk perfomance, run this script on a client running on the OST.
	
Syntax:
	$ ost-survey [-h] [-s <size>] <lustre_path>
	where		   -s : size in MB
			   -h : help
	        <lustre_path> : mount point of lustre client

Assumptions
	- Lustre filesystem is up and running
	- Script is being run on a client


plot-ost (OST survey graph)
===========================
	The plot-ost script can be used to plot the results from the
ost-survey script using gnuplot.

Syntax: $ ost-survey /mnt/lustre > ost_log
	$ plot-ost ost_log

This bundle includes four tools:
In order of preference:

sgpdd-survey: - a test of the 'bare metal' performance, bypassing
as much of the kernel as we can. Does not require Lustre, does
require the sgp_dd package.  WILL ERASE ALL DATA ON DEVICE.

obdfilter-survey:
Shell script - tests performance of isolated OSTS, network 
via echo clients, end-to-end test. 

obdsurvey: - a test of Lustre performance with three modes:
Maintained by Scali, included here as an extra.
Requires Python > 2.2
Requires Lustre

- local disk test - requires one OST
- network performance test - requires two Lustre machines
- network + disk test - requires Lustre filesystem and client

ior-survey:
A script to run the IOR benchmark. Version 2.8.6 of IOR is included

ost-survey:
This is OST performance survey, designed to test the client-to-disk 
performance of the individual OSTs in a Lustre filesystem.
